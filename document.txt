The "moveRover" function simulates the movement of aRover based on a set of commands to move the rover 
we make an function that take parameters 

    - x: positive  or negative number
    - y: positive  or negative number
    - heading (string): the  heading of the Rover,  "NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST" or "WEST" capitalized
 
commands:should be only one of: "F", "B", "L", "R" 
F -> Move forward on current heading
B -> Move backwards on current heading
L -> Rotate left by 90 degrees
R -> Rotate right by 90 degrees

How the function woreks :

    The function will loop over the commands, and will move the Rover forward or backward (depending on the command) if the command is "F" or "B". 
    If the command is "L" or "R" it will rotate the Rover in the direction of the command.

    
    The function will return an error message when using any other commands other than F B L R


    we will loop over the commands( "F", "B", "L", "R") to move the rover according to the position  of the rover heading.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    the unit test for the function for
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    1-check for space (start + end) of heading as we rmove the spacing in the heading  parameter
    2-check if heading start with (_) underscore as we remove the underscore
    3-not supported commands of ( "F", "B", "L", "R") return an error message('not supported')
